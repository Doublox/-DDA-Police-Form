## A Police Form For FiveM  (i think the policeform is standalone)

 Description :

Hello, I took back an old script of PoliceForm for a server but the design did not please them of the blow Me then my friends decided to make a refoundation As its those which do not like the basic policeform will be able to choose! ah yes I forgot to change the variables of the webhook if by chance an angel could make it work and to make a pull request that could help certain in short voila Good evening has you!

[Version of without modification](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-application-police-form/1918729)

We tweaked the html css and even the javascript by changing some variables and adding some elements
I remind you that this script is 90% finished, you have to finish it!

**Also a lot of credit goes to DlaV and ademo **
**I worked on it because I had to present it **
**But they worked on it voluntarily** :laughing:
